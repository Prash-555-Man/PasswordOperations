# Password Generator

## Description
The Password Generator is a Python-based application that creates secure and random passwords based on user-defined length. It ensures strong password generation by including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The program is designed with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, making it easy for users to interact and generate passwords effortlessly.

## Features
- **Customizable Length**: Users can specify the desired password length.
- **Strong Password Generation**: The generated password includes:
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Numbers (0-9)
  - Special characters (!@#$%^&*(), etc.)
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application uses a Tkinter-based GUI.
- **Error Handling**: Provides alerts for invalid inputs, such as non-numeric entries or lengths below a minimum threshold.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Tkinter is included in standard Python installations, so no additional installation is required.

### Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
3. Run the script directly without any additional package installations.

## Usage
### Running the Program
Execute the following command to launch the GUI:
```sh
python password_generator.py
```

### How to Use
1. Enter the desired password length in the input box.
2. Click the "Generate Password" button.
3. The application will generate a secure password and display it on the screen.

## Code Explanation
The program uses the `random` and `string` modules to generate passwords:
- `string.ascii_letters` includes both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- `string.digits` adds numeric characters.
- `string.punctuation` includes special symbols.
- The `random.choice()` function selects characters randomly from the available pool to construct the password.

A validation check ensures that the password length is at least 4 characters for better security.

## Example Output
| Input Length | Generated Password |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 8           | aB3$dFgH          |
| 12          | Xy1!z@R4qP9s      |
| 16          | P@2rT5v#Zx8qY!Ms  |

## Security Considerations
- Avoid using common words or easily guessable patterns.
- Use a password manager to store complex passwords securely.
- Regularly update passwords to enhance security.
