## üîê Encryption Details
- Uses **Fernet encryption** from the `cryptography` library.
- A **secret key (`secret.key`)** is generated for encryption & decryption.
- Passwords are **stored in an encrypted file (`passwords.enc`)**.

## Installation
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**
Ensure Python is installed, then install `cryptography`:

## Example Output
| Website   | Username | Encrypted Password (Stored) |
|-----------|----------|----------------------------|
| google.com | user123  | gAAAAABf@3‚Ä¶ (encrypted)   |
| github.com | devuser  | xYzaq1!9R‚Ä¶ (encrypted)   |

## üîê Security Considerations
- **Passwords are encrypted** before storage.
- **Keep the `secret.key` safe**‚Äîlosing it means **you can't decrypt stored passwords**.
- **Avoid weak passwords** (minimum **8 characters** recommended).

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Add **a master password** to control access.  
- Implement **search functionality** for saved credentials.  
- Create a **cloud sync option** for remote password access.
