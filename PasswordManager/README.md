# Password Manager

## Description
The **Password Manager** is a Python-based application with a **Tkinter GUI** that allows users to securely store, generate, and retrieve passwords. It helps manage multiple credentials efficiently in a single file.

## Features
- **Securely Store Passwords**: Save website, username, and password.
- **Generate Strong Passwords**: Uses a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- **View Saved Passwords**: Retrieve stored credentials in a readable format.
- **Simple and User-Friendly UI**: Built using Tkinter.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Tkinter is included in standard Python installations.

### Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository or download `password_manager.py`.
2. Ensure Python is installed.
3. Run the script using:

```sh
python password_manager.py
```

## Usage
### Running the Application
1. Open the script and enter the required details:
   - **Website**
   - **Username**
   - **Password** (or generate one)
2. Click "**Save**" to store credentials.
3. Click "**View Saved Passwords**" to retrieve stored credentials.

## Code Explanation
The script uses:
- **Tkinter** for UI components.
- **`random` & `string` modules** for password generation.
- **File Handling (`passwords.txt`)** for storing and retrieving credentials.

## Example Output
| Website   | Username | Generated Password |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| google.com | user123  | @aB3$dFgH        |
| github.com | devuser  | Xy1!z@R4qP9s     |

## Security Considerations
- **Do not store plain-text passwords** (consider encrypting with `cryptography`).
- **Use a master password** to protect stored credentials.
- **Avoid using short passwords** (minimum recommended length is **8 characters**).

## Future Improvements
- **Add encryption for secure storage.**
- **Implement a search feature to find passwords easily.**
- **Introduce a master password for additional protection.**
