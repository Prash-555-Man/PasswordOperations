# 🔍 Password Vulnerability Scanner

## 📌 Description
The **Password Vulnerability Scanner** is a Python-based security tool that evaluates the strength of a password. It checks for **common weaknesses**, such as:  
✔️ Short passwords (less than 8 characters)  
✔️ Use of common weak passwords (e.g., "123456", "password")  
✔️ Lack of character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special symbols)  

The **Tkinter GUI** makes it easy to enter a password and instantly check its **security level**.

## ✨ Features
✅ **Real-time Password Strength Analysis**  
✅ **Checks for Commonly Used Weak Passwords**  
✅ **Character Variety Analysis** (Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, Special Characters)  
✅ **Tkinter UI for User-Friendly Interaction**  
✅ **Security Warnings for Weak Passwords**

## 📥 Installation

### 1️⃣ **Install Python**  
Ensure Python is installed on your system. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  

### 2️⃣ **Install Dependencies**  
Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python, but you can install `requests` if you plan to extend the project with online password breach checks.  
```sh
pip install requests
```

### 3️⃣ **Run the Application**  
```sh
python password_vulnerability_scanner.py
```

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Enter a Password** – Type your password into the input box.  
2. **Click "Check Password"** – The system will analyze its strength.  
3. **Results:**  
   - ✅ **STRONG** – Secure password  
   - ⚠️ **MEDIUM** – Needs improvement  
   - ❌ **WEAK** – Unsafe password

## 📜 Example Output
| Password Input | Strength Level | Reason |
|---------------|---------------|--------|
| `123456`      | ❌ Weak        | Too common |
| `hello123`    | ❌ Weak        | Lacks uppercase & special characters |
| `P@ssw0rd!`   | ✅ Strong      | Good mix of characters |
| `AbC123!@#`   | ✅ Strong      | Excellent complexity |

## 🔐 Security Considerations
✔ **Avoid using common passwords** (e.g., "admin", "123456")  
✔ **Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**  
✔ **Consider using a password manager for complex passwords**

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
🔜 **Check passwords against online breached databases (Have I Been Pwned API)**  
🔜 **Suggest stronger password alternatives**  
🔜 **Advanced reporting with entropy analysis**
